                    One of Africas biggest problems is unacceptable high maternal mortality.
                    About 295 000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2017.
                    The vast majority of these deaths (94%) occurred in low-resource settings, and most could have been prevented.
                    In 2017, Sub-Saharan Africa alone accounted for roughly two-thirds (196 000) of maternal deaths in the world (World Health Organization, 2019).
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an effort to reduce these numbers, Nigerian-based start-up Lifebank launched a blood delivering service in 2015.
                    An on-demand service, with fast deliveries across key locations in Nigeria.
                    Founder Temie Giwa-Tubosun told in a interview that by April 2020, Lifebank had delivered 20.000 blood units to over 400 small and large hospitals
                    – resulting in saving 6776 lives, where 75% was women and children (Aoaeh, 2020).

                <p>
                    In 2019 Lifebank announced that they would start delivering blood units, supplies and oxygen by drones.
                    This innovative solution is the first African led company that has implemented Beyond Visual Line of Sign (BVLS)
                    flights for healthcare logistics. Which means that the drone can operate without human interference. Lifebank hopes
                    this can expand them beyond their limits and reach more remote locations (Eikwealor, 2019).  
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    September 2020, announced Lifebank that they are going to expand their business to Kenya.
                    With a stated goal of saving more than 1 million lives across Africa (Babatunde, 2020),
                    there’s no doubt Lifebank is aiming high in more than one way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lifebank is a result of one mother, acknowledging a big problem and doing something about it.
                    2020 is the first year Lifebank breaks even, which is a big testament to the importance of investment in the region.
