            One of Africas biggest problems is unacceptably high maternal
            mortality. About 295 000 women died during and following pregnancy
            and childbirth in 2017. The vast majority of these deaths (94%)
            occurred in low-resource settings, and most could have been
            prevented. In 2017, Sub-Saharan Africa alone accounted for roughly
            two-thirds (196 000) of maternal deaths globally (World Health
            Organization, 2019).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As an effort to reduce these numbers, Nigerian-based startup
            Lifebank launched a blood delivering service in 2015. An on-demand
            service with fast deliveries across key locations in Nigeria.
            Founder Temie Giwa-Tubosun told in an interview that by April 2020,
            Lifebank had delivered 20.000 blood units to over 400 small and
            large hospitals – resulting in saving 6776 lives, where 75% was
            women and children (Aoaeh, 2020).

          />

          <p>
            In 2019 Lifebank announced that they would start delivering blood
            units, supplies, and oxygen by drones. This innovative solution is
            the first African led company that has implemented Beyond Visual
            Line of Sign (BVLS) flights for healthcare logistics. This means
            that the drone can operate without human control. Lifebank hopes
            this can help them reach more remote locations (Eikwealor, 2019).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In September 2020, Lifebank announced that they are going to expand
            their business to Kenya. With a stated goal of saving more than 1
            million lives across Africa (Babatunde, 2020), there’s no doubt
            Lifebank is aiming high in more than one way.
          </p>

            Lifebank is a result of one mother acknowledging a big problem and
            doing something about it. 2020 is the first year Lifebank is making
            money, which is a big testament to the importance of investment in
            the continent. <a href="../pages/solution.html"
