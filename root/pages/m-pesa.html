                    One of the biggest innovations that have taken place in the African continent in decades is the M-Pesa program.
                    In Kenya, 72% have a mobile money account (Piper, 2020), largely due to M-Pesa (Weller, 2020).
                    The M-Pesa program allows its users to transer money without having bank accounts ("M-Pesa", 2020).
                    Additionally, it offers other banking services, such as loans, savings accounts, and more ("M-Pesa", 2020).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many reasons why the program is so great. Firstly, the increase in productivity and conveninence for Kenyan,
                    and other african nations’ citizens have been substantial. Here is a quote from a Kenyan entrepreneur:
                </p>
                <p class="kursive">
                  “M-PESA has changed my life; it helps me make savings. I don’t need to travel to and from the bank every now and then because
                  I can now deposit and withdraw from my bank account using the M-PESA platform. Previously, I used to make between five and ten trips to the bank in a week.
                  I rarely visit my bank anymore,” says Mr Mungai, shop owner. (Harris, 2020)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secondly, the innovation has increased the safety for the recipients (Fernandes, 2020). This is both because of the fact that M-Pesa users
                    to not have to carry their entire wage with them back to their village, or send the money with buses, both of which are common problem many
                    people in the African continent face (Add reference). Lastly, the M-Pesa service has inspired and enabled other African entrepreneurs and
                    businesses to chase their dreams (S., 2020).
                </p>
                <p>
                    M-Pesa is the perfect example of what can be done if entrepreneurs with great ideas are given the tools they need to get their business up and running.
