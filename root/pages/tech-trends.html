            Africa has been experiencing an intense explosion of tech hubs
            during 2019 (Kazeem, 2020). A tech hub is a community â€“ informal or
            otherwise - that fosters innovation for technology startup companies
            (Svetlik, 2020). Moreover, this shows that the continent is indeed
            not slowing down and that the implementation of innovation and
            startups is deepening onto the continent (Kazeem, 2020). The amount
            of tech hubs across Africa grew by nearly 50% during 2019 and during
            this year, Nigeria was leading with 85 tech hubs across the country
            (Kazeem, 2020). Despite this, the best country to be a start up
            company CEO or developer in 2019 was South Africa, as it was one of
            the countries receiving the largest amounts of funding by tech
            investors. (Kazeem, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            Tech hubs initiate tech trends and during 2019 there were a lot of
            tech trends happening. According to an article from Moguldom, the
            year 2019 was likely to see the continuation of increased startup
            investment, as African entrepreneurs would be able to grow their
            businesses thanks to their ability to raise capital (10 African Tech
            Trends That Will Define The Year 2019, 2020). The following is a
            tech trend that defined the year 2019: Artificial intelligence
            becomes mainstream in Africa as 80% of large enterprises are
            investing in AI while 30% are planning to invest during the next 3
            years (10 African Tech Trends That Will Define The Year 2019, 2020)
            (Columbus, 2020).

          <p>
            As shown, Africa was introduced to huge tech trends during the year
            2019 and would go on to be expected of experiencing more impactful
            tech trends in 2020. Africa is full of innovators and entrepreneurs
            ready to expand their ideas and companies. If anything, thinking of
            Africa as an underdog in the tech world is not only false
            information, but the thought itself keeps getting disproven by
            African entrepreneurs every year.
