            Africa has been experiencing an intense explosion of tech hubs
            during 2019 (Kazeem, 2020). A tech hub is a community â€“ informal or
            otherwise - that fosters innovation for technology startup companies
            (Svetlik, 2020). Moreover, this shows that the continent is indeed
            not slowing down and that the amount of innovation and startups is
            growing in the continent (Kazeem, 2020). The amount of tech hubs
            across Africa grew by nearly 50% during 2019, and during this year,
            Nigeria was leading with 85 tech hubs across the country (Kazeem,
            2020). Despite this, the best country to be a startup company CEO or
            developer in 2019 was South Africa, as it was one of the countries
            receiving the largest amounts of funding by tech investors. (Kazeem,
            2020).

            Tech hubs create tech trends, and during 2019 there were many tech
            trends. According to an article from Moguldom, the year 2019 was
            likely continue seeing increased startup investment, and African
            entrepreneurs would be able to grow their businesses thanks to their
            ability to raise capital (10 African Tech Trends That Will Define
            The Year 2019, 2020). The following is a tech trend that defined the
            year 2019: Artificial intelligence becomes mainstream in Africa as
            80% of large enterprises are investing in AI, while 30% are planning
            to invest during the next 3 years (10 African Tech Trends That Will
            Define The Year 2019, 2020) (Columbus, 2020).
